.class
#id
*
element
element, element      (apply to both elements)
element1 element2     (apply to element2 when element 2 is inside of element 1)
element1 > element2   (apply to element 2 when element 1 is direct parent
element1 + element2   (apply to element2, which is right after element1)
:hover
:last-child
:first-child
!important (not recommended)
